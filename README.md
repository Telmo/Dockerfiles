Dockerfiles for various dev projects. This is just a home for them.

I make *NO* promises that these will work for you, or that I will even
maintain them and keep them up to date. I'm just storing them here for
my own use. 

In general they started off as I explored what I wanted or needed. I'm a
bit of a minimalist so they don't install too much up front. These are for
dev, I can always roll up a project later in its own. :)
